# ⛏ GoldMiner

GoldMiner is a tool for finding interesting\* messages in a Slack channel and
turning them into a blog post for the [thoughtbot blog].

It uses the Slack API to [search for messages in a channel], then it groups and
[formats them into a markdown blog post].

_\* At this point, "interesting" means "messages that contain 'TIL', 'tip' or
have been reacted with the :rupee-gold: emoji"._

[search for messages in a channel]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/gold_miner/blob/main/lib/gold_miner/slack/client.rb#L34
[formats them into a markdown blog post]: https://github.com/thoughtbot/gold_miner/blob/main/lib/gold_miner/blog_post.rb#L14

## Installation

First, clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:thoughtbot/gold_miner.git
```

Then, run the setup script:

```sh
bin/setup
```

You'll need a Slack API token. You can get it [on 1Password] (search for "Slack
API Token"). If that doesn't work, ask [someone on the team] for help.

[on 1password]: https://start.1password.com/signin
[someone on the team]: https://thoughtbot.slack.com/apps/A040W2T48BF-gold-miner?tab=more_info

Alternatively, see the "Register your own app with Slack" section below for the
steps to create your own app and User Token.

After setting the token on the `.env` file, rerun the setup script to finish the
installation.

### Setup OpenAI (optional)

If you'd like the help of an AI to generate a blog post, you can set the
`OPEN_AI_API_TOKEN` environment variable. To get one, create an account and
generate a token on the [OpenAI website](https://openai.com/api).

## Usage

To generate a blog post, run the following command:

```sh
exe/gold_miner
```

GoldMiner will search on the #dev channel by default. You can also specify a
different channel:

```sh
# Search on the #design channel
exe/gold_miner design
```

This will output a markdown article. Use that as a basis for opening a [new blog
post PR].

> **Note**
> In the future, GoldMiner [will open] a PR for you.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run
`rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive
prompt that will allow you to experiment.

## Register your own app with Slack

To register an app with Slack you just need to give it a name and select a
workspace to develop it. After that, you will be able to generate Bot and User
Tokens from your App settings page. A User Token is needed instead of a
Bot Token because Gold Miner uses Slack's [search.messages] API which is only
available for User Tokens.

- Go to https://api.slack.com/apps and click on "Create New App"
  and then click "From scratch"
- Give it a name, select your workspace, and click "Create App"
- After that, go to "Add features and functionality > Permissions"
- Scroll down to "Scopes > User Token Scopes" and give your app the
  following scopes:
  - `search:read` to have access to [search.messages]
  - `users:read` to have access to [users.info]
- Then scroll back up to "OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace"
  and click "Install to Workspace"
- You will be redirected to a page asking you to allow your app to be
  installed to the workspace and listing the scopes/permissions you've selected
- Click "Allow"

[search.messages]: https://api.slack.com/methods/search.messages
[users.info]: https://api.slack.com/methods/users.info

Now you have your personal app installed to the workspace and with Bot and User
Tokens generated.

Go back to your App settings page, click "Add features and functionality >
Permissions", then copy the "User OAuth Token" and set it to `SLACK_API_TOKEN`
in your `.env` file.
